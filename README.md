# Autonomous-ATV-using-ROS-API
Autonomous Ground Vehicle Laboratory(AGV lab) , IIT Kharagpur

Keywords: ROS,Shell-scripting,3D-mapping

Using roskinetic api with added features of rosbridge to google map API and mavros link to Arducopter's database , an autonomous all terrain vehicle was made.
A successful attempt to make a 3D plot using a LiDar using that could be used as a light insensitive obstacle detector.

Hardware Used :
Raspberry 3 (Raspbian OS)
ATMEGA2560
APM2.8
